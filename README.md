# iOS Simulator UDID Action

The **iOS Simulator UDID Action** is a custom GitHub Action designed to automate the retrieval of the UDID for an iOS Simulator. This UDID is essential for configuring and running Appium tests for iOS applications.

## Features
- Installs Xcode command-line tools if not already installed.
- Configures the Xcode environment to use the correct version.
- Creates and boots an iOS Simulator (`iPhone-13` running `iOS 17.0`).
- Outputs the simulator's UDID to a `udid.txt` file, which can be used in subsequent steps or workflows.

## Requirements
- **Runner**: macOS (`macos-latest`).
- **Xcode**: Pre-installed on the GitHub Actions runner.

## Outputs
- **`udid.txt`**: A file containing the UDID of the created iOS Simulator.

## Usage

### Example Workflow
